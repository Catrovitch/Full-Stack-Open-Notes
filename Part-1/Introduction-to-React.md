# Introduction to React
To create a default base when using React use command:
```
create-react-app
```
To start the application:
```
npm start
```
By default the application runs on localhost port 3000. The address is http://localhost:3000.
See Part1 > Examples > Part1 for example of creating a base React app.

## Component
- A component is something to be rendered in React
- Create Components in a separate directory
- Then import them to ex. index.js
- index.js is then conencted to pubil/index.html which places the compent in the correct place
- Technically the Component is called a JavaScript function.

This is how a variable is declared with JavaScript ("App" being the name of the variable):
```
const App = ...
```

There are several ways to set up functions in JavaScript. This is how an arrow-function is set up:
```
() => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello world</p>
  </div>
)
```
