# JavaScript
- Browser do not always support the newest version of JavaScript. To get around this problem there are methods of transpiling newer JavaScript to older versions.
- This is most commonly done today with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)is a JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js is based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and is almost universal in where it works - servers, mobile phones.
  
## Variables
There are many ways to define variables in JavaScript.
```
const x = 1
let y = 5

console.log(x, y)   // 1, 5 are printed
y += 10
console.log(x, y)   // 1, 15 are printed
y = 'sometext'
console.log(x, y)   // 1, sometext are printed
x = 4               // causes an error
```

- const = constant - the value can not be changed
- let = normal variable (value can be changed)
- Trying to change the value of a constant will cause an error
- var = similar to "let", but with subtle variances. It is adviced in this course to use a mix of "const" and "let".
